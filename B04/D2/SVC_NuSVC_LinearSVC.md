### Results and Observations:

* **Accuracy:** SVC with RBF kernel and NuSVC show higher accuracy compared to LinearSVC because of their ability to handle non-linear data. Although LinearSVC is faster and less complex, it is not suitable for non-linear shaped data like the moon dataset.
* **Decision Boundary:**

  * SVC and NuSVC with RBF kernel create curved boundaries that adapt to the data shape, offering better classification.
  * LinearSVC only produces a straight line, making it less effective when the data has complex non-linear patterns.

### Reason for Model Selection:

* **SVC with RBF Kernel** is selected as the most suitable model for the moon dataset due to its excellent non-linear classification capabilities and highest accuracy among the tested models. SVC effectively demonstrates its advantage when data cannot be separated linearly, which aligns well with the problem requirements.
